# Amazon Fire Game Jam

Some games that I made during a Game Jam hosted by Amazon (theme: "Fire")

These were made as some of the first test games that were proofs of concept for Crayon.

That was a very long time ago. The games aren't particularly good, but are worth keeping
around for archival/sentimental purposes. But they don't really belong in the Crayon
source tree anymore, that's for sure. So here they are.

A third game was created during this game jam, but was simple enough to keep ported to 
the most recent version of Crayon and remains in the Crayon source tree. And actually
kind of fun. It can be seen at:
